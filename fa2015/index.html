		<h2>Progress this semester:</h2>

		<br/><br/>

		<strong>Lightning Talks:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>arandr/xrandr display utilities</li>
			<li>The Daily Programmer subreddit</li>
			<li>ADUni: A free digital university</li>
			<li>Flash Player, and why it's recommended to avoid it on non-Windows platforms</li>
			<li>Fresh Player: Pepperflash for Firefox</li>
			<li>Elevator Saga: Learn JavaScript the fun way!</li>
			<li>File Manager talk (Presentation of a whole bunch of alternative/minimal file managers)</li>
			<li>Telnet Antics -- various webpages and responses via telnet and HTTP 1.1</li>
			<li>Visual Studio Code: An alternative code editor with gdb integration and extension support!</li>
			<li>Microsoft Open Source involvement, and Linux distribution</li>
			<li>...and more that got lost along the way!</li>
		</ul>

		<strong>Server Room:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Maintainer of Comm, which currently runs an XMPP and Mumble server</li>
			<li>Various bits of cleanup/organization, particularly involving the file cabinets</li>
			<li>Helped set up/troubleshoot aspects of the VM machines on several occasions</li>
			<li>Creator/maintainer of the core backup server</li>	
			<li>Assistance with cable cleanup and routing</li>
			<li>General troubleshooting throughout the semester and tracking down/notifying the right people</li>
			<li>Question box/guide for some of our newer members who needed help setting things up in the server room</li>
		</ul>

		<strong>Backup System:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Elephant: Our cobbled-together but entirely viable backup server built from scraps:</li>
				<ul>
				<li>A spare i7 and power supply from our previous generation of lab machines</li>
				<li>A spare motherboard from a lab machine two generations back</li>
				<li>One 120GB HDD pulled from an old lab machine</li>
				<li>Five 3TB HDD's pilfered from our generously donated rack-mount NAS devices</li>
				<li>A fan from the CAMP technology disposal area</li>
				<li>...all mounted in one of the oldest 3U server cases we have, whose LEDs don't work!</li>
				<li>Despite all of this, it's actually a pretty robust system. It should go for a while!</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Set up the 120gb drive with a basic debian install and setup user accounts</li>
			<li>Helped set up DNS resolution to elephant@cslabs</li>
			<li>Configured the 3TB drives to work in RAID6 via mdadm</li>
			<li>Created a backup user with read/write to only the backup folder at the root of the RAID array</li>
			<li>Generated ssh keys for authentication of the backup user, so it doesn't need to be tied in to talos</li>
			<li>Worked out rsync commands to pull data over ssh with preserved disk sparsity and resume on fail</li>
			<li>Set up a basic cron job on Metapod to backup all user directory files</li> 
			<li>Created resume and suspend scripts for the machines on our VM hosts</li>
			<li>Modified the above to walk through each VM, suspend it, back it up, and resume it[in progress]</li>
			<li>Hooked the above into a cron job[in progress]</li>
			<li>Still trying to track down Graham to get Talos backups encrypted/stored</li>
			<li>Documentation of each step in the process[Still pending formatting/upload to docs]</li>
		</ul>
